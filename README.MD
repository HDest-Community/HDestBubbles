##### A fork of emmy-gote's version of Hideous Destructor Bubbles.

What is Hideous Destructor Bubbles? Well Josh771, the original mod creator, says:

> This add-on makes many of the items in Hideous Destructor float in front of players when they have them equipped.
> It optionally also shows that a player is wearing a backpack.
> Some of the "bubbles" are even animated when used!

##### What has been changed in this fork:

> - Updated to target latest HD main
> - Added support for WIMP
> - Added CVar to allow bubbled weapons to appear to the user
